While most would consider the 1972 Avian-Human Reconciliation as the foundation of modern Bird Law, the proliferation of Bird Law as we know it can be traced back to a much earlier time.

## A Beginning in Rome

Indeed, records of Bird Law have been found as far back as 17 B.C. when Roman Emperor Tiberius Caesar Augustus issued the Declaration of Dull Wings, an edict that operationalized the Roman Empire's harsh stance on seagulls – condemning them to the punishment of hanging or stoning for stealing food from humans. The actual logistics of hanging guilty seagulls we may never know. What we do know from these existing records is that Tiberius has had perhaps the most significant impact on avian-human relations - even greater than the Bird Wars of 1896.

Tiberius grew up in a family of poor farmers on the eastern banks of the Euphrates. Surviving scraps of his journal reveal Tiberius' deep-seated hatred for all things feathered. In an entry dated March 5, 20 B.C., Tiberius indicated that he “hates… birds". Millennia of decay have damaged this record, leaving significant unidentifiable text in the broken phrase. Though, most historians agree that even without the full context, Tiberius' anti-bird stance is well supported by his anti-bird and bird-phobic policies. 

## The Declaration of Dull Wings

On the back of the Declaration of Dull Wings, Tiberius ushered in one of the most expansive and technologically impressive capital projects the world had ever seen – aimed exclusively at keeping the “feathery pests" out of Rome. Often confused with his expansion of the Roman military to dominate the nation state's neighbors, Tiberius commissioned the construction of over 300 trebuchets designed to specifically take out aerial targets. Each trebuchet was strategically placed throughout Rome to provide ample coverage of the sky. Mountains of small pebbles stationed alongside each of the installations provided a plethora of ammunition. In the span of three months, over 3,000 troops – a sizable portion of the Roman militia – had been commandeered for the aviation operation and received in-depth training on the use of these massive weapons. With limited space in many corners of the bustling city, the siting of trebuchets often meant the displacement of long-tenured market stalls or religious pulpits – the first indirect victims of this brutal sky assault.

## Unintended Consequences

The operation was unsuccessful to say the least. With each launch of a trebuchet, pellets rained down on unsuspecting citizens. Downpours of small stones left many running for cover – those who could not reach safety were subject to flurries of pellet-sized wounds, and in a few rare cases, an unsuspecting death. Though, that wasn't the only problem. The new climate of hard stones created a long-term problem as small pebbles began to pile up across the city. In letters recovered from archaeological dig sites, residents would complain to government officials about stones ruining the wheels of horse carriages and causing the more elderly populations regular trouble with dangerous slips and falls. In an ironic twist, the militia began to witness birds consuming the countless pebbles that they had strewn across the city. It was soon after identified that the consumption of rocks served to aid birds' digestion and support the health of the avian population. To make matters worse, Roman militia had only recorded a paltry 16 verified kills of in the first 6 months of the campaign – a stark contrast to the 43 civilian deaths that it had caused and hours of road congestion.

With civilian support rapidly eroding across Rome, Tiberius was incensed with the pitiful performance of his campaign. Instead of reevaluating the approach and strategy, the campaign’s widespread failure only emboldened his stubborn nature. Much to the chagrin of Roman citizens and the militia, Tiberius expanded his campaign – ordering the development of even more trebuchets as well as the conscription of an additional 15,000 troops. With much of his forces already deployed in imperialistic conflicts across western Asia and eastern Europe, Tiberius bypassed his esteemed cabinet to officially lower the minimum age of conscripts from age 15 to age 10. It became apparent to many of the contemporary strategists how much of a blunder this was for Tiberius: “Not only are the children of poor education and training, but their forced conscription has brought great shame to our once mighty Roman forces. A fierce disdain burns in the hearts of mothers and fathers across the land for a government that has torn away from them their children to sling rocks at feathered pests”.  

After two unsuccessful years, the situation had reached its boiling point. Rome’s borders were failing as its forces dwindled in European and Asian campaigns. Poorly managed expansions to militia had only exacerbated the inefficiency of the acts following the Declaration of Dull Wings. With just four more verified bird deaths a year-and-a-half after the initial report to Tiberius, civilian casualties of the trebuchets had skyrocketed to 162. With the failures racking up in foreign and domestic policies, Tiberius had completely lost the support of the Roman public and even the militia. Tiberius was overthrown in 22 B.C. as Mongol invaders encircled the Roman empire. In the following year, decades of Roman expansion and progress were transformed into burning rubble and ash.  

### The End of Rome

Amongst the rubble and recovered historical documents, some important questions remain:  

Can Tiberius’ Declaration of Dull Wings be attributed as the cause of the fall of the Roman empire? Surviving writings from philosophers and strategists at the time largely believed that the declaration would contribute to Rome’s downfall. “Bloodthirsty enemies at Rome’s frail borders, an unkempt militia comprised of toddlers and ne'er-do-wells causing more harm to their own bodies than of their cause, and a population incited to such passionate anger so severe that outsiders may fear contracting what appears to be a collective insanity prescribed by vengeful gods”. While we may never know the full impact that the declaration played in Rome’s complicated downfall, we know that it was at least an important contributor.  

And in the modern day, what can we learn from Tiberius’ failure? Perhaps it is to never underestimate the bird – a creature who thrived in the face of an assault by one of the world’s fiercest fighting forces at the time, absorbing their trebuchets’ spent ammunition to improve the efficacy of the excretory missiles that it fired uncaringly upon unsuspecting civilians. To the Romans, the birds were nothing more than an uncontrollable force of nature that acted upon a shared whim to inconvenience humanity. It wouldn’t be until many millennia later bird’s more sinister nature had begun to unravel.
